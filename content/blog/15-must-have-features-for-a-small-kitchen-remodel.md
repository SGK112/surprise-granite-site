Open Shelving in Small Kitchen

## 1. Open Shelving

If you have a small kitchen, you need to prioritize your use of space. There are various ways to do this, and open shelving is one of the most effective options. It allows you to use wall space that would otherwise likely be empty for storage.

Depending on the layout of your kitchen, you may be able to place shelves in different areas. People often use these for things like herbs and spices, glassware, or decorative ornaments.

When doing this, however, think about how the finished space will look. More shelves mean more storage space, but this could also end up making your kitchen look cluttered and unorganized. Ideally, you want to find a balance that gives you some more space while still looking stylish.

## 2. Divided Cabinet Space

One of the key limitations in a small kitchen is often cabinet space. You can make up for this to a degree by using vertical or horizontal dividers.

These can be great for storing narrow pans and baking sheets conveniently. You'll have different slots and won't have to try and balance everything in one stack. You can have wooden dividers installed inside your cabinets or drawers or use metal and steel options for a more modular option.

## 3. Narrow Pull-Out Drawer

Storage is vital in a kitchen - especially a small one. Making the most of the cabinet space available can be incredibly helpful. A great way to do this is with narrow pull-out drawers between appliances or other cabinets.

They let you make good use of tight spaces so you can store more items away. They can include various shelves and storage spaces making them ideal for different items.

By organizing these items efficiently, you can make your small kitchen look more open and less cluttered.

**Best Items for a Narrow Pull-Out Drawer:**

- Spices and seasoning bottles
- Cooking oils and vinegars
- Baking sheets and cutting boards
- Canned goods and jars
- Small kitchen gadgets (e.g., peelers, graters, and measuring cups)
- Cleaning supplies (e.g., sponges, scrubbers, and dish soap)
- Plastic wrap, aluminum foil, and parchment paper

## 4. Use a Magnetic Knife Holder

Efficiency is everything in a small kitchen, and while some changes might feel insignificant, every inch of saved space helps. One simple way to be more efficient with space is to use a magnetic knife holder. Install one of these on your wall and you'll have an incredibly convenient place to keep your cooking knives.

Knives may not typically take up much space, but if you're working with less drawer space than most, this can be a great option. You can stop your cutlery drawer from becoming overcluttered, and you'll have quick, easy access to your knives whenever you need them. It's even possible to get a magnetic knife holder with a built-in sharpener for added convenience.

## 5. Space Saving Cabinet Doors

When remodeling your kitchen there's a lot to think about. As such, there's a lot that's easy to miss. One thing that many people don't consider too much is their cabinet door style.

Most people get standard doors that swing open, but you can save a bit of space by opting for sliding doors instead. These won't need to protrude into the room at all so you can have a clear space to work at all times.

## 6. Corner Storage

In a small kitchen, it's important to make effective use of all the space available. It's easy to waste corner space, but with dedicated corner storage, you can use it effectively.

You can install a unit with carousel shelving that rotates into the corner. This makes great use of space that would otherwise be wasted, and it's easy to access anything you have stored here.

## 7. Whites and Neutral Colors

You may not be able to make your kitchen any bigger, but that doesn't mean you can't make it *feel*bigger. [Light colors](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/project-ideas-inspiration/interiors/make-small-room-look-bigger-brighter) are a great way to do this.

You can use light paint on the walls and cabinets to make the entire room feel more spacious. Combine this with natural colors to add some visual interest. Whether you go for quartz, marble, or another material, you can get countertops with a range of light colors and patterns to match whatever aesthetic you're after.

## 8. Invest in Small Kitchen or Multi Use Appliances

There are certain appliances that you'll need in your kitchen, but they can vary a lot. Small appliances can help you save a lot of extra space in your kitchen while still ensuring you can cook full meals with ease.

Smaller appliances will take up less space on your worktop and you can store them more easily. For example, if you don't use your kettle too often, it's easy to keep a small one on a high shelf so it's out of the way.

Don't just think about size here, but also use. Some appliances have multiple functions for extra convenience. For example, you could get a combination microwave and convection oven so you don't need two separate appliances.

Natural Light in Small Kitchen

## 9. Maximize Natural Light

Depending on your home, it may be tricky to add a lot of natural light. The more you can get into your kitchen, the more spacious it will feel.

When carrying out your remodel, think about the windows and how they'll work with the rest of the room. Adding large windows where possible can make quite a significant difference.

Skylights are perfect for this as they let in plenty of natural light. They also won't take up any wall space that you might want to use for shelves, cabinets, or other storage.

Make sure you also have ample lighting installed. When the sun sets, you'll still want your kitchen to be well-lit so you can use it without any issues.

## 10. Glass Doors

There's plenty of flexibility when it comes to cabinetry, and if you want to add a bit of style, you can include glass doors. These can be built into your cabinetry offering a far more decorative appearance than standard doors. They also give kitchens a lighter feel, creating the illusion of more space in a similar way to natural lighting.

If you have any quality china or glassware that you'd like to display, this is ideal. You can choose the design of the doors, opting for either mullion or open-frame cabinet doors depending on the aesthetic you want.

## 11. Use a Mini Backsplash

You'll want to [have a backsplash](https://www.surprisegranite.com/blog/what-are-the-different-types-of-backsplash-options-for-your-kitchen) behind your sink and stove to protect the wall from splashes. These can vary in size, and going with a smaller one can be ideal in a small kitchen.

A larger backsplash can sometimes overwhelm a kitchen and look somewhat out of place. You may want to downsize to a smaller one that fits in better and doesn't extend over a short run of cabinetry.

## 12. High-Style Faucet

You'll spend plenty of time using your sink, so you want to make sure that it's both stylish and functional. There are [all kinds](https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-kitchen-faucet-6541575) of kitchen faucets available, so you have plenty of choice here.

High-style faucets can be incredibly useful, as they give you a bit more space in your sink. This is perfect for washing pans and other large items.

When looking for faucets, take the rest of your kitchen aesthetic into consideration. You want to make sure you go for a [color and style](https://www.surprisegranite.com/blog/the-modern-kitchen-sink-trends-options-and-materials-you-need-to-know) that will work well with everything else.

## 13. Install a Modular Table

Many kitchens are combined with dining areas or have a small section that's suitable for eating meals. In a small kitchen, this typically isn't practical. However, you can achieve this by installing a modular table.

This kind of table can fold away so you still have plenty of space then you can fold it out when needed. You could even use this as an additional surface when preparing meals. Just bear in mind that it won't have the [same durability](https://www.surprisegranite.com/blog/7-reasons-to-install-granite-countertops) as most countertops, so be careful with things like hot pans.

## 14. Cookware Rack

Pots and pans can take up a lot of space. While this isn't an issue for some people, those with a smaller kitchen might find themselves feeling somewhat restricted.

If this is the case, you want to make the best use of the space available to you. A cookware rack is perfect here.

You can hang various pots and pans from it so you don't need to store them in cabinets. Not only does this give you extra cabinet/countertop space that you can then use more effectively, but it also makes accessing your pots and pans quick and easy.

## 15. Invisible Hardware

Protruding cabinet handles and knobs may not take up a huge amount of space, but they can make things feel more cramped. You can choose to have cabinets with a lip or touch lap to provide a seamless, minimal look. This lack of visual interruptions will make the space feel more open and clean.

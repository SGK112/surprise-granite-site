Since the average bathroom remodel job [costs about $11,328](https://www.angi.com/articles/how-much-does-bathroom-remodel-cost.htm), it's important that you get the best bang for your buck. Deciding how your beautiful bathroom should look and outlining your dream design scheme is the first step toward successful renovations.

## 1. Natural, Minimalistic Looks

Minimalism is the idea that less is more. This means clean, bold lines and monochromatic color schemes. In 2023, natural materials and aesthetics are in, so using wood as a design material is a great choice.

Wood bathroom vanities and cabinets are coming back in style. Despite several years of gray and white furniture reigning as a top bathroom trend, people are coming back to a more natural look. It doesn't just create an air of elegance, but it gives you a chance to showcase more complex patterns and naturally occurring hues.

You can showcase the best features of wood furniture with other wood accents. Mirror frames, towel bars, and shelving can all be made from wood that matches your vanity. You can also paint these accents to add a pop of color to a natural, monochromatic palette.

## 2. Pops of Color

Speaking of color, using various tones to draw your bathroom together is another 2023 trend. All-white uniform bathrooms are going out of style because they lack visual complexity and feel clinical. Instead, colored accents can [alter your mood](https://www.verywellmind.com/color-psychology-2795824) and make you feel energized or relaxed.

You can use multiple shades of pastel blue or bright yellow. Jewel tones are great for those looking to make a loud statement. Pale hues are ideal for those who want a calmer space.

Since monochromatic color schemes consist of multiple tones of one color + neutral hues, this is a great way to get in on one of the best design schemes out there.

## 3. Patterned Drapes and Curtains

2023 homeowners are investing in an overall more thoughtful bathroom design. This doesn't just mean adding more color. It also means adding textures and patterns into bathroom accents like rugs, drapery, and curtains.

Bathrooms are made up of several hard surfaces like stone countertops and tile flooring. Fabric with textures and patterns really stands out and makes the room feel softer and cozier. It contrasts with the cool tones in these flat surfaces and creates more complexity.

Consider floral prints because they're a classic that never goes out of style. Bathroom-safe rugs with oriental-style prints also look great because of their soft organic shapes and deep colors.

## 4. Textures, Textures, and More Textures

Using the right countertop slabs and backsplash tiles can also create texture in your space. Whether you choose granite or quartz, a natural material will have one-of-a-kind textures and patterns on every slab. They're visually stunning because of their unique complexities and veining.

You can get [granite countertops](https://www.surprisegranite.com/countertop-services/granite-countertop-installation-services) or quartz options in several base hues, including black, white, grey, cream, and warm beige. Greige- a newer hue that combines the cool undertones in gray with the warmer ones in beige- is also a great countertop option.

There are great options with various types of veining. There's an option for you whether you want a coarser-looking surface with geometric lines or something with a smooth base and thin spider veins.

You can also add texture in the form of great backsplash and floor tiles.

These can match your countertops or provide some contrast within your space. Consider getting a backsplash in colors that match your countertops but with slightly different veining or patterns. Tiles also come in many different unique shapes like honeycombs, subway patterns, and diamonds.

## 5. Inspiration From Spas

In recent years, people have begun to perceive their bathrooms as wellness spaces. This means that people are looking for:

- Freestanding tubs
- Tables near the tubs to hold books, wine glasses, and candles
- Comfortable seating so that you can enjoy the steam while outside of the tub
- Side sprays
- Dual shower heads

This makes the bathroom feel like something luxurious and comfortable. You can maintain this feeling better by dividing your bathroom into two parts with a glass wall and door. Your toilet and sink will be separated from what essentially becomes a steam room.

## 6. Sustainable Trends

2023 homeowners are more conscious of their carbon footprint than ever before. Natural wood and quality stone countertops are a huge part of this, but there's more to [sustainable design](https://www.homesandgardens.com/bathrooms/sustainable-bathroom-ideas#:~:text=What%20are%20sustainable%20bathroom%20ideas,as%20boilers%20and%20eco%20heating.) than that.

It's essential that you install new countertops, backsplashes, and floor tile. If you don't, you might end up with damaged and chipped materials. You might also simply end up with something that isn't sealed off correctly and collects debris in the pores.

However, there are other ways that you can make your bathroom sustainable. Repurposed and recycled storage furniture is ideal, as are eco-paints and energy-efficient appliances. These appliances may include fans, floor heating, and plastic-free designs.

Being energy efficient doesn't just help save the world. It can also save you money on utility bills. Energy-efficient appliances don't need to run as hard as others or take up as much electricity.

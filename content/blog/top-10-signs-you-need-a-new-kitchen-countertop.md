Since over [50% of American homes](https://comfyliving.net/home-remodeling-statistics/) were built before 1980, occasional renovations are more than necessary. Your kitchen is usually in more need of remodeling than other spaces since it's one of the most-used rooms in your home.

Getting new kitchen countertops is critical for keeping your home in shape. But what are the signs that investing in a new countertop is necessary? Read on to learn some signs that a kitchen renovation project should be on the horizon.

## 1. Cracked Surface

After many years of use, cracking and chipping are natural on any countertop. The weight of storing kitchen utensils and the impact of chopping knives can cause cracks over several years. While other areas of the countertop may be functional, investing in a new one sooner rather than later will give you more space to work.

Cracked countertops also look ugly and can tarnish the aesthetic of an otherwise beautiful kitchen. Replacing them is critical if you want a well-kept-up kitchen and a home that looks loved.

## 2. Erosion or Scorching

Cracks aren't the only sign of a damaged kitchen countertop. Acidic foods like meats, eggs, beans, and salty dishes can erode your countertop when spilled. The erosion likely happens over several years or if you aren't meticulous about cleaning up spills.

Scorched countertops are also common for those who place hot pans and trays directly on the surface. If you notice any erosion or scorching, it's important that you buy a new countertop to ensure that your kitchen doesn't look messy and careless.

## 3. Staining

While stains aren't as severe an issue as cracking or scorching, they can place a serious damper on your kitchen aesthetic. If you have porous countertops or haven't sealed them correctly, stains are likely permanent. Getting a new countertop is your best bet if you want to remove these unsightly marks.

## 4. It's Time for a Change

[Kitchen design trends](https://www.hgtv.com/design/rooms/kitchens/17-top-kitchen-design-trends-pictures) are constantly changing and it's important to make sure that your space looks modern. We've all seen kitchens with yellow and pink appliances that look like they never left the 50s. You don't want any version of the vibes that these kitchens give off (even if the situation is less extreme).

If you're sensing that your countertop may be going out of style, replacing it is a good idea. This is especially true if you've had it for a decade or more. Replacing it also will prevent more serious damages down the line including cracks and scratches.

## 5. You're Performing Other Kitchen Renovations

Did you know that [34% of people](https://realtybiznews.com/study-finds-that-home-renovation-can-be-good-for-your-mental-health/98760026/) believe that home renovations have contributed to better mental health? Projects are fulfilling and fun, especially when you see an immediate impact. They also switch up your space to keep your mind feeling refreshed and energized.

When you perform other much-needed renovations to your kitchen flooring, lighting, or appliances, it's a good time to replace your countertops. Getting everything done at once feels great and ensures that you don't forget everything. Plus, you can get things that match for a more cohesive aesthetic!

## 6. You Have the Wrong Types of Kitchen Countertops

There are tons of kitchen countertop material options on the market. Solid-surface metal, ceramic tile, and laminates are more popular than ever before, but they scratch and chip extremely easily. Soapstone has a similar problem because it's so soft that simply cutting vegetables can break it.

Not all countertop surfaces were created equal, and you'll need [granite or engineered quartz](https://www.surprisegranite.com/#&gid=1563632334&pid=1) for a fully-functional kitchen. They don't just look better than alternatives but also provide you with peace of mind. Plus, since these high-end stone countertops are made to last, they're a great investment financially.

## 7. Water Damage

Regardless of what type of countertop you have, water damage is a serious and nearly inevitable issue. You may notice a crusty white buildup under the countertop even if you don't see any water spots or stains on its top surface.

This will most likely happen on a surface area that's close to your kitchen sink or another place with running water. The water leaves a nearly impossible-to-remove stain. A replacement is also necessary here because you want to nip the problem in the bud before mold develops.

## 8. Mold or Mildew

If you don't spot water damage quickly, you likely will find yourself with mold and mildew on the bottom of your countertops. This isn't something that you want to mess around with since mold is persistent and can cause [serious health problems.](https://health.ri.gov/healthrisks/mold/#:~:text=Exposure%20to%20a%20large%20number,causing%20more%20severe%20allergic%20reactions.)

Make sure that you replace your countertops immediately upon noticing any growths. It could potentially save you from lifelong respiratory problems and even cardiac issues.

## 9. You Changed Your Cooking Habits

Another practical reason to invest in a new kitchen countertop is that you recently have changed your cooking habits. If you previously lived off microwave meals but now plan to do more cooking, you're going to need more space.

Replacing all of the countertops throughout your kitchen is the best way to give it a consistent and cohesive aesthetic. This is especially important if you plan to entertain more guests and need the counter space for them to sit down comfortably. You want to show them that you have impeccable decorating tastes.

## 10. You're Selling Your Home

If you plan to move soon and want to sell your home for the best price, new kitchen countertops can boost the value of your home. Revamping all areas of your house- including your kitchen- is a great way to ensure that you get the best possible price. Since replacing kitchen countertops is an affordable renovation, it's also an investment that's sure to yield a high return.

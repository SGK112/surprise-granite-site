With the holidays on the way, you may be looking around your home trying to figure out how to spruce it up before everyone gets in town. Your bathroom might be feeling a little drab and overdue for a refresh. One great way to breathe new life into this space is to put in a new bathroom backsplash.

## 1. Subway Tile

[Subway tile ](https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/backsplash/subway-tile-arrangements/) is one of the most popular options for bathrooms and kitchens today, and for good reason. This rectangular tile comes in a variety of dimensions, ranging from mini tiles to full 12” x 2” pieces. Most subway tiles are around 4” x 8” and lend a gorgeous modern look to your bathroom.

You can get subway tiles in a variety of different colors and finishes, with clean white being among the most popular. You can play with different looks by changing the layout of your tiles. For a more modern look, stick to a vertical layout or a traditional brick pattern; for something a little more elegant, play with a herringbone pattern.

## 2. Graphic Tiles

If you’re wanting to add a little personality and color[to your bathroom](/blog/bathroom-renovation-tips-tricks), there are few better ways to do it than with graphic tiles. These tiles come in a variety of colors and patterns, so you can find a look that will fit with your décor scheme. You can also find them in a variety of sizes, though most come in square dimensions.

For a bohemian feel, look for a tile with flower patterns and bold jewel-tone colors. If you want bathroom sink backsplash ideas that are a little more modern, get a tile with a geometric pattern in neutral shades. You can even get a gorgeous classic look with a blue china pattern or art deco designs; there are dozens of options for you to choose from.

## 3. Oversized Tile

When you’re working with a small space, making it feel bigger is the name of the game. One great way to do this is to get an oversized tile to hang on your walls. Not only will using 18” x 18” or 24” x 24” tiles make your space feel larger, but it will also make installation easier, since you won’t have to hang as many tiles.

If you’re using oversized tiles to make a small space seem bigger, stick to light colors to keep things airy. It’s also a good idea to avoid patterned tiles when you’re installing pieces this large. The pattern may seem grand in the box, but when you put it on your wall, it can start to get overwhelming.

## 4. Penny Tile

Penny tile is another bathroom classic, and it can be a great way to bring a little bit of retro to your bathroom. As you might guess from the name, penny tile is made of small round tiles about the size of a penny. This tile comes in sheets that you can easily trim to fit whatever space you’re working with.

When you’re installing penny tile, it’s a good idea to stick to bold colors, such as black, white, or dark blues. Pastel colors can start to make your space feel like it just stepped out of the 1950s. You can also mix and match colors to create fun patterns if you’re feeling adventurous with your bathroom design.

## 5. Mixed Materials

There’s no rule that says you can only use tile to create your bathroom backsplash. Let’s say you love the modern cleanness of subway tile, but you want to warm it up a little bit. You can add some wood accent pieces between rows of tile to break up the look a little and bring in a natural element to your bathroom.

If you plan to mix materials like this, be sure you do your homework first. As seasons change, materials like wood expand and contract, potentially leaving you with gaps around these accent pieces. Check if you need to use a [special grout](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grout-tile-2132520) or some other sort of flexible material around your wood pieces so you don’t wind up with cracked grout the first time the weather turns cold.

## 6. Glass Tile

Glass tile can be a fantastic way to bring a little bit of shine into your bathroom, no matter what style it is. These tiles have a colored background that’s laid under a piece of clear glass. That little bit of depth between the pattern and the surface of the tile can make everything seem a little shinier and brighter than with painted ceramic tiles.

You can find all sorts of glass tile patterns, beginning with subway-style tiles that are an elegant twist on the classic style. You can also get some of the graphic tiles we discussed with a glass finish over them. You can also get different tile cuts, ranging from rectangular and square to gorgeous arabesque tiles.

## Benefits of Choosing Stone Over Laminate or Tile for Countertop Replacement

While laminate countertops are less expensive than stone, there's almost no resale value. They're vulnerable to scratching as well as heat and moisture damage.

The porous grout used with tile can easily absorb juices from uncooked food. This creates a haven for dangerous bacteria growth. Tile and grout lines are susceptible to staining. They can also become scratched or cracked from impact or heat exposure.

You can’t repair this damage without compromising the surface. Often, you must replace it in part or whole. Current trends see homeowners replacing laminate countertops as well as tile with stone. Stone countertops provide a solid surface that can last forever.

They’re more resistant to water, heat, and stain damage. If light staining or other imperfections occur, you can refinish the stone to look new. Stone, such as granite and quartz, allow you to create a unique focal point in your kitchen. These countertops offer a luxurious atmosphere that stands the test of time.

They’re also a wise financial choice. Studies show that [stone countertops](/materials/countertops/granite-countertops)' average return on investment is 60 to 80 percent.

## Top Trends in Kitchen Countertop Replacement Options

During the past two years, people have spent more time in their houses than before. While cooking and eating at home, they've taken notice of the kitchen's condition. This has led many individuals to make plans to upgrade their countertops and backsplashes.

The following provides an overview of some of the top kitchen countertop trends in 2021.

### 1. Quartz

Over the past year, quartz has become one of the most popular choices for countertops. Also called “engineered stone”, it’s a composite of quartz crystals in a binding agent such as resin.

You can choose a wide variety of patterns to suit your style. Examples include nature-inspired, marble-looks, concrete looks, and more. It’s available in many colors from icy white tones to midnight black.

Quartz doesn’t require sealing and offers a highly durable option. Just provide basic cleaning and will last for years.

### 2. Granite

Granite, a natural stone, has been popular for many years. Each unique slab brings nature’s beauty into your home. You'll find many color blends and patterns to choose from.

The non-porous property of granite reduces bacteria growth because it doesn't trap food and dirt. This helps ensure a more sanitary kitchen. It’s also heat and scratch-resistant.

Choosing granite countertops also [adds to your home’s value ](https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/construction/materials/granite-countertops4.htm). It won’t depreciate over time which makes it a wise investment.

### 3. Eco-Friendly

Environmental sustainability has become a major focal point across the globe. For many homeowners, today, making eco-responsible choices is at the top of their list.

In fact, one study reported that [almost 70 percent](https://www.environmentalleader.com/2021/06/sustainably-minded-customers-the-new-era-of-sustainability/) of U.S. and Canadian buyers seek sustainable options. If it harms the environment, they’ll make another choice.

Quartz countertops use recycled materials and stone which reduces waste. It’s also 100 percent recyclable if it’s removed in the future.

Properly sealed granite countertops offer another eco-responsible option. They don’t need chemical cleaning agents since they don’t collect dirt and dust. This lowers the number of harmful chemicals in our environment.

### 4. Polished vs Honed Finish

You can choose different finish options for your countertops and backsplashes. A polished type provides a glossy appearance. Conversely, a honed or matte finish has very little shine. In 2021, there’s a rising trend toward choosing honed finishes.

You can find quartz, granite, and marble countertops with this matte look. Many individuals prefer this option because it hides scratches and marks. This keeps your kitchen looking new.

### 5. Color and Contrast

Do you prefer bright and bold features in your home? Or do you like lighter, more subtle designs? Stone allows you to find the perfect look to fit your style.

You may want whiter colors with subtle accents for an airy, open, bright ambiance. Light-colored quartz is found in many homes today. In 2021, colored countertop trends are taking kitchens to the next level. If you want to create a fun, vibrant accent, choose rich red or even a bold blue.

How about black with large, light-colored waves or patterns to make your statement? Suddenly, your kitchen becomes an exciting focal point.

### 6. Subtle Patterns

Does your vision tend toward a more sophisticated and elegant aesthetic? If so, you may prefer minimal patterns and designs. Ice-white or light-colored quartz with subtle, realistic accents provides this artistic appeal.

Today, some homeowners are replacing granite countertops with brighter quartz. While granite has been a stone of choice for years, some trends are moving away from it. Ultimately, it’s all about what you like and how you want your kitchen to look.

## How To Replace Kitchen Counters

When you’re ready to replace your kitchen counters, decide if you want to DIY or hire a professional. For most homeowners, installing stone can pose a big challenge. There are many advantages to hiring an expert to handle this job.

Granite installation, for example, is a complex process. It’s best to have a highly skilled and experienced professional handle this project. This ensures level countertops with precise grout lines to prevent future problems.

Quartz and granite are heavy and need the proper materials and tools to move and place them. This reduces the risk of damage or breakage during installation. Lack of experience and the right equipment can even result in injury.

Choosing to DIY may seem like a less expensive option at first. But will you need to buy special tools? Is it worth the risk of damaging the stone or someone getting hurt?

In the end, you may pay more to replace a damaged stone or pay for healthcare.

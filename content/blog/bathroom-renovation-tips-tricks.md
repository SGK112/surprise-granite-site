The folks over at Zillow have crunched the numbers. A bathroom renovation continues to yield one of the biggest returns on investment.[More specifically](https://www.zillow.com/sellers-guide/roi-for-bathroom-remodel/), they cite a $1.71 return for every $1 you spend. Of course, the main impetus behind a bathroom remodel is often to elevate your sanctuary, the place you go to wash off the day and unwind. Still, a little long-term thinking never hurt a soul.

Below, we'll walk you through several renovation tips and tricks, especially if you're having trouble choosing the best material for your makeover.

## Formica vs. Tile vs. Stone

If you're considering a bathroom update, there are a few reasons we'd choose stone over Formica and tile.

### Formica

It's true Formica is a nice, affordable option. But, are you really getting your money's worth? It can be particularly troublesome in the bathroom because it can be burned or scorched easily.

When you consider the hot implements that inhabit a bathroom (hairdryers, hair straighteners, and curling irons), this creates a real dilemma. What we see happen over time is that the Formica delaminates on the edges. For a product that's only known to have a 10-year lifespan, it would be a real disappointment to see it delaminate before its time.

### Tile

We can't deny tile is a go-to in bathrooms all across the globe. The color, texture, and pattern options alone are enjoyable to consider. But, when it comes to bathroom countertops, we really hesitate. Traditional ceramic tiles are made of clay and they only have a surface glaze.

Of course, you have porcelain tile which is harder and denser. But, no matter which material you use, it's still more brittle when you stack it up against a stone surface. The other downfall to any type of tile is the fact that grout lines tend to stain and discolor over time. Indeed, the cleaning (and potential for resealing) makes this a far more high-maintenance material than stone.

### Stone

Meanwhile, stone is durable and it's not affected by hot or sharp implements. As for its lifespan, it can exceed 50 years. The different variations of stone (which we're about to discuss in a moment) are premium building materials that speak of luxury.

Stone is also a unique material. No two granite or marble slabs will ever look alike. Some materials are more porous than others (e.g., marble is more porous than granite). But, they're far more durable than Formica or tile, offer unmatched elegance, and will last the longest.

## Marble Countertops

When families choose marble, they almost always opt for white marble. We love this option for bathroom countertops because few options look as pure and natural as white marble.

The interesting patterns created by its veining are also endlessly elegant. Although marble is known for its top-shelf appearance, it's actually sourced from all over the globe. So, it's not as difficult to get ahold of as one might think.

Given the jaw-dropping splash of elegance it provides, it can also increase the value of your property. Again, while that may not be the impetus to remodel your bathroom, it sure is a nice payoff.

## Granite Countertops

There's a reason granite is a go-to choice for kitchen and bathroom countertops. It's durable; it's real stone; and it comes in a wide variety of colors. Whereas marble tends to have a lot more veining than granite, granite tends to have more flecks of color. So, it all depends on your personal style.

As you start to explore[granite countertops](/materials/countertops/granite-countertops) for your bathroom remodel, there are a few things to consider.

### Choose a Thick Slab

There are varying thicknesses to granite countertop slabs. We recommend choosing something that's at least one inch thick. Anything less will be more fragile. Often, slabs that are 3/4" or less require laminate edges and supports. (In which case, you're doing yourself a disservice because this harkens back to Formica.)

### Look for Cracks

Take a good, hard look at the slab you're investing in and make sure there are no hairline cracks. A good contractor would never allow this to happen, anyway. But, do your due diligence. A simple hairline fracture can escalate into a larger fragment that could bring about great damage.

### Avoid Harsh Chemicals

Post-installation, try to avoid acidic cleaners on your granite countertops. This can cause the sealant to weaken and dull its glorious glisten.

Along with harsh chemicals, avoid abrasive sponges or Brillo pads. Even though we're talking about a solid piece of stone, these cleaning tools could potentially scratch the surface.

## Quartz Countertops

[Quartz countertops](/materials/countertops/quartz-countertops) are equally beautiful. While granite and marble are giant slabs of stone that have been cut and prepared for installation, quartz is actually stone particles set in epoxy.

In truth, the manufacturing process makes quartz your most colorful option. It's just as durable as granite (or even concrete), but it doesn't have the same hardness.

This is a real[selling point ](https://www.thespruce.com/facts-about-quartz-countertops-1821233)for some homeowners. Meanwhile, it remains stain-resistant because it's non-porous. Also due to its non-porous nature, it won't be a harbinger for mold or bacteria. This makes it a great contender for the bathroom.

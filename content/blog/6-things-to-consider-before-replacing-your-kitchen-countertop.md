Did you know that a kitchen remodel could give you [as much as a 93 percent](https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/clean-and-organize/which-home-improvements-pay-off) return on your investment? Kitchen remodeling is one of the few home improvement projects that adds that much value to your house, so it’s important to get them right. And one of the biggest decisions in a remodeling project is what sort of countertop you’re going to install.

There are dozens of different options for countertop materials, so how do you choose the right one for you? Read on to discover some of the things you’ll need to consider before installing new kitchen counters.

## 1) The Quality of Your Cabinets

Before you pick out your kitchen countertop material, the first thing you need to do is think about the quality of your current kitchen cabinets. For one thing, you’ll need to decide if you want to keep them or replace them. If you plan to replace your cabinets within the next few years, it’s best to replace everything all at once so you avoid paying double installation fees.

You also need to make sure that your cabinets can support the weight of your new counters. Some lower-grade cabinets may not have the structural integrity to hold up heavier counter materials. Granite that’s three-quarters of an inch thick weighs about eighteen pounds per square foot, which means your counters could wind up weighing several hundred pounds.

## 2) Your Sink Configuration

You’ll also need to consider the configuration of your sink when you get ready to replace your countertop. If you have a [farmhouse sink](https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/decorating/decorating-kitchen/farmhouse-sink-pros-cons) that sits below the level of the countertop, you may not have to replace it when you replace your counters. But sinks that sit on top of the counter will often have to be replaced or at least have the plumbing reconfigured before you put in the new counters. 

Your new counter may be taller than your previous countertops, meaning your sink drain pipe won’t reach the bottom of the sink. You may also have to adjust the faucet configuration to fit the new counters. It’s best to talk to your counter installers about whether you can work with your current sink or if you’ll need to replace it.

## 3) Your Backsplash

When you’re replacing your counters, you’ll also need to take a hard look at your backsplash. New countertops can make your kitchen feel like a whole new space, especially if you’re also getting new cabinets. But an outdated backsplash can suddenly look much more out of place and, in some cases, may not even fit with your new counters.

If your new countertops are thicker than your previous ones, your backsplash will extend down too low on the wall and will run into your new counters. You may also want to create a new design for your kitchen remodel project with the counter replacement. Unless your old and new counters are very similar, replacing your backsplash is probably a good idea.

## 4) Your Upkeep Desires

Now that you’ve considered all the surrounding factors in your kitchen renovation, you’ll be ready to turn your eye to picking out materials. As we’ll discuss more in a moment, your aesthetic will naturally be an important factor in choosing your material. But you also want to think about how much maintenance and upkeep you want to do with your new counters. 

Marble, [granite, and other natural stone](https://www.surprisegranite.com/blog/buying-granite-for-your-home-everything-you-need-to-know) counters will need to be sealed and require specialized cleaning care. Concrete, quartz, and solid surface counters are all maintenance-free. And natural materials like copper and wood may not require a ton of upkeep, but they will get a worn, used look over the years. 

## 5) Your Aesthetic 

Perhaps the biggest factor in choosing your countertop material is your personal design aesthetic. Your counters are the primary focal point for your kitchen and will set the tone for the entire room. You want to pick not only something that will go with your color scheme but also something that you’ll love for years to come. 

If you’re looking for a modern or minimalistic option, quartz, solid surface, and concrete countertops can be a fantastic option. Granite and marble create a traditional, high-end feel, while tile will make things feel older and more European. And if you want something a little more rustic, wood or copper may be a fantastic choice for your home.

## 6) Your Budget

As much fun as it is to shop for different counter materials, it’s also important to turn your attention to more practical matters. You need to consider your budget when choosing your countertop materials. Of course, the size of your kitchen will play a role in the price of your counters, but your material will be the single biggest factor.

If you have a larger budget, materials like natural stone and quartz may be on the table, as will copper and wood. If your budget is more mid-range, you may be able to get some limited patterns of granite or concrete. If your budget is very limited, you may need to start looking at laminate and other such options.

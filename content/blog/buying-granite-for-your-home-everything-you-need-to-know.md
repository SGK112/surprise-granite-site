According to stats, granite countertops are an overwhelming popular countertop choice, gracing[over 64% of new homes ](https://eyeonhousing.org/2016/10/features-and-colors-of-kitchens-in-new-homes/).

There's a reason why granite countertops are everlasting popular.

They are a classic choice and will stand the test of time both aesthetically and physically. Granite is a highly durable countertop material. It's also easy to maintain and keep clean and comes in a wide variety of colors and veining patterns.

However, to enjoy all[granite's benefits ](/blog/7-key-benefits-of-having-granite-countertops)to the fullest, it's imperative that you approach the buying process armed with the right information.

## Invest Time Into Picking the Right Color and Veining When Buying Granite

The first tip around buying granite is to take your time selecting the ideal color and veining for your home.

One of the attractions of[natural stone countertops](/blog/natural-stone-countertops-everything-you-need-to-know)is that every slab is 100% unique. No two slabs are identical, which gives you the chance to add a truly one-of-kind element to your home.

At the same time, this also means that picking out the perfect slab can take a little more time.

Start by evaluating your overall kitchen design style and color scheme. Is it bold, contrasting, and modern?

Are you going for a moody, opulent look—or one that is light and airy?

Also, think about whether you want your stone countertops to be a focal point, or whether they should blend into the rest of the kitchen. If you want them to stand out and make a statement, then opt for a bold or unusual pattern or color.

On the other hand, if you want your counters to add a subtle design element, opt for understated veining and patterns and a neutral color.

As we mentioned above, one of the advantages of granite is it comes in a wide range of colors and veining patterns. This means that you should be able to [find a slab ](/materials/countertops/granite-countertops) to suit any interior design theme.

## Keep In Mind That Thicker Equals Stronger

Another thing to keep in mind around buying granite is that that thicker granite slabs are stronger.

When you buy granite countertops, it can be tempting to opt for thinner slabs that come with a cheaper price tag. Unfortunately, while this might save you on costs initially, in the long run, it can actually be an expensive decision.

Nowadays, it's common for granite slabs to be ¾-inch thick. These slabs have more chance of breaking and cracking over time, simply because of their thinness.

If you want your slab to stand the test of time and last for years and years, then we would recommend you opt for a 1-inch slab.

That said, there might be certain circumstances where a thinner slab isn't the worst decision. For instance, if you are flipping a home, and are faced with the decision between a manmade counter option and natural stone—but a 1-inch slab is out of your budget—then opting for a ¾-inch granite slab could be a better decision.

## Go Local

If possible, we would also suggest that you go local when choosing a supplier and installer. Buying and installing granite counters is a big decision. Therefore, you want to be able to have your supplier and installer on hand.

For one, this can allow you to view slabs in person, which is key in the decision making process. As we already mentioned, natural stone slabs are all unique. Being able to view a slab in person will give you a better visual on how it will tie into your home.

Also, opting for a local installer can also make the design process easier, faster, and more personalized.

Lastly, going local can also help you save on transport and installation costs.

## View the Entire Slab

Before you buy a granite slab, you should always view the whole piece. Samples can give you a decent idea of what a slab looks like, as can photos and videos. But to really get an accurate visual of a slab you need to see it in its entirety. Veining can take an unexpected turn, and inclusions can pop up anywhere.

If you are going to invest in a slab of natural granite, then it's worth taking the time to view it physically and really absorb its overall appearance. After all,[typical granite costs ](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cost-of-granite-countertops/)are between $40-60$ per square foot before labor and installation.

The last thing you want to do is buy granite stone for your kitchen, only to regret your slab choice once it's installed.

## Leave the Measuring up to Your Contractor

Lastly, don't rely on your own measurements when ordering and buying granite.

There are a few nuances that affect exactly how much material you need for countertops. To be 100% sure that you are ordering the right amount, it's best to leave the measuring up to your contractor.

They will know what to account for and how to accurately work out how much material you will need. A skilled installer will also be able to plan around problem areas and make sure that your slab looks as seamless as possible once cut and installed.

## Wondering Where to Buy Granite?

Investing in granite countertops can elevate your home and transform your kitchen from run-off-the-mill to designer-grade.

When buying granite, it's important to take time over your slab selection. After all, granite is an investment, you want to make a purchasing decision you're happy with.

If you're planning to stay in your home for years to come, you should also consider opting for a thicker granite slab. Lastly, leave the measuring to the professionals, and choose a local installer and supplier if you can.

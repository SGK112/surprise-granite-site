Kitchen remodeling is the second-most popular home improvement project. And, depending on how much you spend—it can have an attractive ROI. If you undertake a minor kitchen remodel, you could achieve an [ROI of 83%](http://myconsumersvoice.com/kitchen-remodel/statistics-kitchen-remodeling/) should you sell your home. 

Redoing your kitchen backsplash is a high-impact way to upgrade your space, without tackling expensive changes such as redoing cabinetry or moving plumbing.

The kitchen backsplash area is an automatic focal point. It's important to give serious thought to what kitchen backsplash ideas will work best in your space. You also want to pick something that's current, but won't go out of style in ten minutes. 

Avoid backsplash regret and keep reading for the types of backsplash styles that are most on-trend for some inspiration. 

## Slab Backsplashes

One of the most popular [types of backsplash](https://www.surprisegranite.com/blog/what-are-the-different-types-of-backsplash-options-for-your-kitchen) designs lately has been slab backsplashes. Slab backsplashes usually incorporate the same material as the counter and carry this up onto the walls.

This gives a very seamless, contemporary, designer-grade feel. Although slab backsplashes have been popular for a couple of years, this trend doesn't show any signs of slowing down.

If you install a slab backsplash, it should continue to look current for many years to come. Slab backsplashes have impact, but they aren't a way-out design choice. Should you sell your home, there's very little chance that buyers will be turned away by a slab backsplash.

What's more, a slab kitchen backsplash will always look high-end. Natural stone slab is an inherently luxurious material and makes for a timeless choice.

One drawback to a slab kitchen backsplash is one of the more expensive options. 

## Counter-to-Ceiling Backsplashes

Another big trend that's happening right now is counter-to-ceiling backsplashes. Instead of stopping backsplash materials a few feet above kitchen counters, designers are taking them to the ceiling.

Although this does take more kitchen backsplash material to achieve, it can be very attractive. Counter-to-ceiling backsplashes help to draw the eye up and create the illusion of a higher ceiling and more vertical space.

Not all kitchens are suited to this trend. But, if you have an area above your kitchen counters that is free of cabinets, this could be the perfect opportunity to incorporate this designer-approved backsplash trend into your space. 

## Ceramic Tiles

Ceramic tiles are one of the most time-honored types of backsplash materials. [Kitchen tiles](https://www.surprisegranite.com/materials/backsplash-tiles) are more affordable than stone slab and are also highly durable, long-lasting, and easy to clean. 

Thanks to this, ceramic tiles never really went out of fashion. However, in the last couple of years, unusual and beautiful ceramic tile kitchen backsplash ideas have been popping up more and more 

The key to nailing the kitchen tile backsplash look and making it pop is to avoid build-grade tile choices. Instead, opt for tiles that have a little more "design" to them, whether it's in the color, finish, size, or the pattern the grout will make. 

## Soldier Tiles, High Gloss, and Herringbone

You can also get a contemporary feel with ceramic tiles by the way you lay them.

For instance, subway tiles reigned supreme for a number of years. It felt like every second kitchen featured subway tile. Inevitably laid in the traditional overlapping brick pattern.

Although classic subway tiles will never truly go out of style, they have lost some of their freshness through overuse.

If you like subway tiles but want to do something a little more current, a fresh way to incorporate them is by doing soldier tiles. Solider tiles offer a more of-the-moment feeling, and you can choose whether to lay them horizontally or vertically.

If you prefer the traditional brick pattern, you can still switch things up a little by choosing larger or smaller subways tiles or selecting an unexpected color or a high-gloss finish. 

For instance, high-gloss dark green tiles have been a big trend in both kitchens and bathrooms over the last year. 

Another trendy, contemporary tile choice is the herringbone pattern. Herringbone gives movement and pattern, and can liven up neutral tiles just enough to give them some extra interest without being over-the-top. 

## Warmer Colors

Speaking of color, don't be afraid to consider warmer tones when shopping for backsplash materials. Although [reports show](https://www.floorcoveringweekly.com/main/fcw-live/houzz-study-highlights-demand-for-countertops--36689) that gray and white are still the dominating colors in kitchens, this is probably going to change. 

Interior designers are increasingly choosing warmer color palettes for interiors. You can expect to see a lot more beiges, browns, and other warm neutrals in the kitchen. 

Although white is a classic choice for a kitchen, gray is falling from favor, and already has a slightly dated, decidedly 2010s feeling. 

## Patterned Backsplashes

Neutral, plain backsplash materials are the most popular, but, with the advent of maximalism, some homeowners are opting for patterned kitchen backsplash ideas.

Patterned kitchen tiles in backsplashes are a great way to add energy and impact to a kitchen. Thanks to their built-in nature, there isn't a lot of opportunity to add things like furniture and art to a kitchen. Because of this, kitchens can sometimes feel a little flat and predictable.

Incorporating pattern into your backsplash is one of the easiest ways to stop your kitchen from feeling bland or boring.

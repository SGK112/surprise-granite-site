Studies show that dysfunctional home design [can take a hit](https://todayshomeowner.com/how-your-home-affects-your-mental-health/) on your mental health. Cluttered or poorly-renovated spaces can cause stress, moodiness, disorganization, and a lack of energy.

Here, we're going to provide you with the ultimate home renovation guide so that you can plan to revamp the right way. Read on to learn some ways that you can make the most out of your upcoming home remodel.

## Plan Your Remodel Meticulously

The first step to planning a successful remodel begins 6-12 months before any renovations actually begin. You need to create a thorough project plan that details exactly what you want to do.

First, clearly define the goal of your renovations. Then do some online research and see what styles and designs best meet your goals. You may want to look at Pinterest boards and professional design websites that showcase ideas for multiple rooms.

After saving some images, you can create an outline for what work you want to be done. List your wants and needs for the project in a spreadsheet and prioritize those that are most important.

Then, divide your project into multiple steps. Distinguish DIY steps from those that may require professional assistance. For example, "paint the kitchen" is often a DIY step, but countertop installation will always require experts.

When applicable, you also can sketch what you want finished projects to look like. A [virtual kitchen design tool](/visualizers/virtual-kitchen-design-tool) may help, as may similar tools for other areas of your home. You can also use a multi-surface room visualizer to see how new countertops, backsplashes, and islands may look post-renovation.

Make sure that local zoning regulations won't deter you before showing them to a professional. If you plan to expand your home rather than simply renovate its existing structure, you may need permits.

## Create a Realistic Budget

Homeowners will pay an [average of $15,000-$20,000](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/home-renovation-costs) to renovate their entire house.

This cost is prone to fluctuate depending on your home's size and what work you want to be completed. It's important that you clearly define your budget so that you can work within your means.

Make sure that you do this 3-6 months before beginning your remodeling job.

First, look into all your accounts and determine how much you have to spend. Take 10% of your budget and set it aside for costs that you don't expect yet. Renovations can bring many sudden changes.

Look online and see how far people tend to get within your budget. You may need to spread your renovations out over time so that you can save more money. Prioritize rooms that are often the most in need of changes like bathrooms and kitchens.

Price out all required materials and jot the figures down on paper or in a digital document. Bring them when you request quotes from professionals who provide you with home goods or remodeling services.

## Hire the Right Contractors

At this point, you know what you can DIY vs what you'll need professional help for. Determine what contractors you will need for the latter tasks.

You will need someone to help you select and [install countertops](/materials/countertops), cabinets, backsplashes, sinks, and more. Surprise Granite is a great choice because of our expert team, many years of experience, transparent pricing, and award-winning services.

When looking for a contractor, those are all things to look into. Ask questions like:

- How long have you been remodeling homes?
- What does your usual payment schedule look like? Is it flexible?
- Have you worked on any homes that look like mine?
- Do you have a contracting license? Can I see it?
- Do you have insurance? Can I see an insurance certificate?
- Might I see some reviews?
- Do you have any references I can call?

This will help you ensure that you're hiring the right team to help you. Do this 2-3 months before you begin renovations.

## Create a Renovations Timeline

2-3 months before work begins, you'll also need to make a timeline for your renovations. You can begin by either choosing a start date or working backward from a completion date.

Talk with your contractors and determine:

- How long each part of your project will take
- Which renovation steps need to be completed before the other steps
- What areas of your home can be renovated at the same time

Make sure that you use a calendar to mark out all project steps. Share it with contractors and family members helping you with DIY steps.

Don't forget to allow time for cleaning out the area of your renovations, mailing materials, and holidays that contractors may be taking off.

## Prepare for Your Renovations

1-2 weeks before your renovations begin, it's time to begin preparing your home. Pack up everything in the spaces that will be redesigned.

People will be working there, and you don't want any safety hazards. You also don't want anything to get ruined such as furniture or flooring.

Make temporary spaces in other areas of your home that will function as the rooms you're renovating. For example, if you're not going to be able to use your kitchen for a while, move some cooking appliances to the living room and slide your dining table somewhere nearby.

This ensures that you will be able to live seamlessly in your home during renovations.

## Tips for a Comprehensive Home Renovation Guide

No home remodeling guide would be complete without some tips and tricks to ensure that everything goes smoothly. Make sure that you:

- Ask all contractors any questions that you have
- Keep your budget and schedule somewhat flexible (this is where the 10% you set aside for unforeseen costs comes in handy)
- Plan ahead to have trash removed from your home
- Cover any furniture or fixtures with tarps for protection
- Ask contractors what they need you to do to prepare the areas

This will make the process easier on you, your family, and everyone assisting you.

Homeowners improvements and repair 2014 to 2025

Remodeling costs have steadily increased since 2014, and while 2024 shows a slight dip, spending is projected to rise again in 2025. 

We’ll explore why December is the ideal time to plan your remodel, from contractor availability to seasonal savings and purchasing power during the holidays.

## Contractor Availability

### Less Project Competition

Fewer homeowners plan kitchen and bath remodels in December because they’re focused on the holidays, leaving contractors with more open schedules. This reduced competition means you’ll have an easier time booking experienced remodelers and getting personalized attention. By starting your project planning now, you can secure their time before the busy season picks up in the new year.

### Year End Project Wrap Ups

December is when many remodelers are finishing projects started earlier in the year, freeing up time and resources like tools and crew members. This creates a window where contractors can shift their focus to new projects without juggling ongoing work.

### Consultations and Plannings

Kitchen and bath remodelers often prioritize consultations and planning to fill their schedules for the upcoming year. With fewer active projects, they have more time to collaborate on detailed designs and accurate estimates.

Putting down a deposit for your kitchen or bath remodel in December can save you thousands compared to waiting until after the new year. Remodelers often raise their prices in January due to higher demand as more homeowners begin their projects.

By putting a deposit down now, you can lock in current prices for both materials and labor while scheduling the project to start at a later date. This allows you to take advantage of your money’s purchasing power and secure priority scheduling before prices increase. [

There's nothing quite like the rarefied beauty of marble, an elegant material that calls to mind Roman sculptures. The material has long been a popular choice for homeowners—after all, the material had a millennia to build a solid fan base.

And if you're preparing to [replace your kitchen countertops, ](/blog/6-trending-countertop-replacement-options-for-a-stylish-kitchen)it's time to think outside the box with marble kitchen countertops.

## Benefits of Marble Kitchen Countertops

Marble's benefits go well beyond its stunning good looks. For instance, did you know that marble is one of the most affordable countertop materials on the market?

Of course, it depends on what type you buy— [Cararra marble ](https://www.hunker.com/13401278/types-of-carrara-marble) is one of the classic Italian white marbles and one of the least expensive options on the market, mostly because it's ready available. Rarer luxury stone (a la Calacatta marble) offer more dramatic veining against a whiter surface, but you pay the luxury sticker price.

For many homeowners, marble countertops are the figurative jeans of countertops. Like a beloved pair of blue jeans, marble countertops gain more organic character and age quite gracefully.

Oh, and if you see a lot of bakeoffs in your future, even in a heat wave, marble is [heat resistant](https://www.hunker.com/13411972/what-counter-tops-can-withstand-heat) (to a point).

## Is a Marble Countertop the Best Countertop for You?

Is a marble countertop the right choice for you? It depends on what you want from a countertop—and how much work you're willing to put into it.

No matter what way you cut it, marble countertops are an investment. As in, every six months investment. Because marble is highly porous, it's highly susceptible to stains (like wine), and once they seep into the stone, they're difficult to reverse. A good sealant can help protect your countertop, but only if you re-seal it every six months.

Marble is also much softer than other natural stone, which means it scratches much more easily. Keep your jewelry and belts out of range.

That said, if you take the time to care for your countertops, they'll treat you very well and age beautifully. So if you're willing to put in the work for a stunning look, marble might be the right fit.

## How to Choose Marble Countertops

Much like a good pair of jeans, marble kitchen countertops are not one-size-fits-all. Here are a few tips to keep in mind before you purchase your countertops.

### White Out Stains

If you're worried about stains as a frequent cook, baker, or parent of small children, stick with white marble.

While most people think of marble as white, there are actually several different colors from black to red to taupe. However, those worried about stains should always stick to white. That might sound counterintuitive, but there's a good reason for it—acid etching on marble leaves a whitish mark which is far more noticeable on colored marble slabs.

The good news? You can find plenty of classic white marble options for a decent price.

### Bring the Pieces Together

Part of the beauty of working with natural stone is that every slab is completely unique. However, this also presents some unique installation challenges, since you don't want your kitchen to look haphazard.

As such, it pays to consider how the slabs will come together *before *you install them.

The best approach is to think of marble veining like a painting. You want the veining to look continuous so the eye doesn't stick on the seam. The best way to do that is to find a longer piece without seams if you can help it. And where seams can't be avoided, make sure to book-match them so that the slabs have a mirrored appearance.

### Check the Veining Patterns

Every piece of marble has its own unique veining pattern. Even two slabs cut from exactly the same quarry can be completely unique from each other. What most people don't know is that you can get a unique veining pattern.

It all comes down to how you cut the marble. Slabs with a linear, striped pattern are cut using a vein cut. But if you're going to book-match marble across seams, you're better suited to a cross cut, which cuts the marble the other way and achieves a more random, open flower pattern that's excellent for book-matching.

### Know the Difference Between Cracks and Fissures

You should also pay attention to the state of the marble before you purchase it from a facility. On that front, cracks and fissures are surprisingly telling, but it's important to remember that they're two different things.

A fissure is a naturally-occurring feature in the stone that doesn't change its integrity and actually lends a bit of character. A crack, on the other hand, is the telltale sign of a slab that's been improperly handled or dropped. You can tell the difference by running your fingernail across it—a fissure won't catch your nail.

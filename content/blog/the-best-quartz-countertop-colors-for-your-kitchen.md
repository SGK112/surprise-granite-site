What's more, this decision is long-term. You'll have your quartz countertop for many, many years to come. This means that you want to get it right.

What colors should you choose? Keep reading to learn about selecting the best colors for a quartz countertop. 

## Tips for Choosing Your Quartz Countertop Color

Knowing what color to choose involves more than just looking at available colors. There are some aspects of your kitchen that you need to take into consideration. When choosing your [quartz countertop](/materials/quartz-countertops) color, consider these tips.

### Steer Away From Overly Bright Colors

Do not choose a color that is overly bright. Countertops need to work with the appliances and other fixtures in your home. The last thing you want is a bright red countertop that clashes with the white cabinets, white kitchen sink, and stainless steel appliances.

### Consider Your Lighting

Do pay attention to the natural light in the room. Those with lots of natural light may want a cooler color with less of a warm tone to it. Warming up an overly cool room with a warm color is a good idea.

### Consider Your Furniture

Neutral colors are generally the best when considering your furniture. If you have stainless steel appliances, white cabinets, and lighter-colored wood floors, you should go with a cooler color like white, gray, or black. If you have darker-colored cabinets and floors, warmer colors like terracotta, cream, or even copper can be a good choice.

### Find Your Style

Are you more [traditional or rustic](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/mix-rustic-traditional-decorating-75106.html)? Do you prefer a modern, minimalist look or something more ornate? All of these things are important and will help determine your quartz counter color.

### Steer Clear Of Unsuitable Colors

Today, there are hundreds of different quartz colors to choose from. Still, there are some colors that you should steer clear of when choosing a quartz countertop.

            <p>Taking the opportunity to get creative and personalize our living space is a lot of fun and incredibly rewarding. However, the process is also time-consuming and expensive, so it's important to take heed of helpful bathroom renovation tips when you find them.</p><p><a href="https://civicscience.com/home-improvement-trends-in-2024-home-renovations-gain-momentum-diy-projects-lead">62% of American homeowners</a>plan to renovate or remodel this year, with most focusing on the bathroom. If you decide to go for it yourself, we've put this handy article together to ensure your bathroom reno checklist isn't missing anything important!</p><p>Bathrooms are typically the first place people decide to renovate, as they're usually smaller spaces, making them a great starting point. Read on to avoid some costly remodeling mistakes and learn what not to do the easy way.</p><h2>Consider Your Design Philosophy</h2><p>As with any substantial project, it pays to get your ducks in order before going ahead with your<a href="https://surprisegranite.com/service/bathroom-remodeling-arizona">bathroom remodel ideas</a>. It might be tempting to start without giving much thought to the grand scheme, but failure to do so will only confuse things. Spend some time thinking not only about the bathroom you're renovating but also how the renovations will tie in with the rest of the house.</p><p>Taking the size of your bathroom into account, as well as how it's going to be used, is a good place to begin. Depending on whether it's a private bathroom connected to a bedroom or a guest bathroom connected to a hallway, your design choices may differ for practicality. When planning for optimum design, starting with foundational guides helps direct the project as a whole.</p><h2>Mistakes to Avoid With Your Bathroom Reno Checklist</h2><p>With the foundational points considered, it's worth making a checklist to ensure each decision aligns with the idea to avoid renovation mistakes. There's nothing worse than progressing smoothly and realizing you're past the point of including something crucial. Having to undo swathes of hard work to correct a simple mistake is easily avoidable with planning and strategy.</p><p>Having your steps mapped out and carefully taking them one by one will save time and effort in the long run. With that in mind, here are some of the most common bathroom design errors to avoid.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6456ce4476abb2d4f9fbad10/66b931ef6d79a7516cf2f759_66b931d2bd1fb04907a007d8_bathroom-renovation-interior.avif" alt="Bathroom remodeling project" loading="lazy"/></figure><h2>1. Not Considering Adequate Lighting</h2><p>Without adequate light, any room will feel dark and dingy. Failure to include sufficient lighting and electrical outlets is a common oversight.</p><p>While it's true that water and electricity don't mix, there's no reason your bathroom can't have safe access to power. After all, hair dryers, electric razors, and many other creature comforts require it.</p><p>When thinking about the kind of light that would work best, consider the ambiance you're looking for. Warm lights work best for a cozy atmosphere, but if you want a minimalist approach, you might prefer a cooler light.</p><p>It all depends on the effect you're looking to achieve. Failure to experiment with<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/people-places-and-things/202106/how-lighting-choices-can-affect-your-mood">lighting options</a>might rob you of the cherry on the cake, so don't be afraid to try something different.</p><h2>2. Failure to Include Sufficient Ventilation</h2><p>Bathrooms are steamy places, and that's how we often like them. Running a hot bath creates a lot of water vapor, which needs somewhere to go.</p><p>Failure to take that into account will cause problems down the road and ultimately make bath time less enjoyable, too. Not taking appropriate measures to reduce or remove humid air can cause issues with mold and material damage.</p><p>Including plans for a robust exhaust fan to pull the humidity out of the room will save you the headache of installing one once you're finished renovating. Failure to include some form of preventative ventilation in your bathroom is an error you can easily avoid. Don't make the mistake of thinking you won't need one because the damage will have been done by the time you do.</p><h2>3. Forgetting About Storage</h2><p>Lack of storage is an issue that often only becomes relevant when you need it. While designing a bathroom, making sure there's a practical storage solution sometimes falls to the wayside in favor of aesthetic options. It's easy to get caught up in the design process and forget that the space is supposed to be functional,<a href="https://surprisegranite.com/blog/6-beautiful-bathroom-design-trends-for-2023">not just beautiful!</a></p><p>When it comes to common design errors, this one is relatively simple to correct. However, it's better to plan for this sort of thing from the beginning. The addition of a small cabinet mirror is a simple fix, and you'll have somewhere to keep your toothbrush, but only as an afterthought.</p><p>If you remember about storage from the start, it might be possible to recess a space into a wall for considerably more storage. Towels and other bulkier items can be kept here, which is a much better alternative than leaving them out to spoil the aesthetic.</p><h2>4. Not Choosing a Big Enough Room</h2><p>Bathrooms are typically put into smaller spaces, as they're usually only used by one person at a time. Just because you won't throw parties in there doesn't mean you don't have to<a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/organizing/g810/small-bathroom-storage/">plan the layout carefully</a>. A small bathroom can feel well-designed, functional, and cozy or cramped and uncomfortable.</p><p>The difference between the two is simple and comes down to planning and foresight. A common mistake is not making sure all the doors open with ample space clearance. If you're able, install the door so it swings outside of the bathroom rather than into it.</p><p>The positioning of the toilet and sink is also important. Nobody likes to feel huddled in the middle of what feels like a closet complete with bathroom amenities, so give some careful thought to their placement.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6456ce4476abb2d4f9fbad10/66b931ef6d79a7516cf2f756_66b931e6f9082a5fba38bbb1_Bathroom.avif" alt="Bathroom remodeling project" loading="lazy"/></figure><h2>5. Not Including Accessibility Hardware</h2><p>Not everyone is fortunate enough to have a body that obeys commands flawlessly, but everyone needs to use the bathroom. This means taking the less able into account and ensuring there's some hardware available to make their lives a little easier.</p><p>While wheelchair access might not always be possible within a residential home, there's no reason not to include grab bars and a curbless shower. Including these will also pay dividends in the long run, as they'll be<a href="https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/ways-to-increase-your-homes-value/">factored into the price</a>if you decide to sell.</p><p>Everyone welcomes these additions, not just people who struggle with mobility issues. Anything that makes life easy for one person will be appreciated by another, regardless of their physical ability. In some cases, ignoring universal design principles might even get you in trouble, depending on where the bathroom is, so it's best to include them from the start.</p><h2>Avoiding Common Design Errors</h2><p>Doing your research is one of the best ways to avoid making simple mistakes during your renovation. The internet is awash with helpful information; all it takes to make the most of it is knowing where to look. Some of the most valuable tips often come directly from homeowners themselves, who've learned the hard way.</p><p>All the best information comes from making mistakes or otherwise missing the mark and correcting the problem. If the progress of your renovation has stalled due to an unforeseen design issue, don't worry: it's all part of the process. Learning from our mistakes is valuable, and the problem-solving process provides answers you'll remember for the rest of your life.</p><p>There's a thriving community of people doing their own work and sharing their hard-won knowledge online. If you're serious about DIY, joining one of these communities and asking questions will net you some gems regarding best practices and what to avoid. You might be surprised at the wealth of knowledge available and how helpful strangers can be when it comes to a common interest.</p><h2>A Stitch in Time</h2><p>Any successful remodel guide should underline the importance of planning and strategy. Renovation happens one step at a time, and each step must build upon the last. This means the thought that goes into each step becomes cumulative, ending in a bathroom greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p>A large part of what allows a renovation to be successful is the quality of the materials used. This is where we come in. When it comes to reliable materials, there's no substitute for<a href="https://surprisegranite.com/company/reviews">high-quality stone solutions</a>, especially in the bathroom.</p><p>Stone is timeless and durable, allowing it to stand up to the rigors of constant use.

            <p>Are you building or renovating a space in your home? If so, it's important to think about the type of countertops you want to install.</p><p>While you have many different options to consider, granite stands out as a top choice. This time-tested material is durable, beautiful, and built to last.</p><p>That's what makes it ideal for your kitchen, laundry room, bathroom, and anywhere else you need to combine form and function. Today, we're sharing seven reasons to install<a href="https://surprisegranite.com/materials/granite-countertops">granite countertops</a>and how we can help!</p><h2>1. Unmatched Durability</h2><p>When you want longevity, you need natural stone countertops. While Formica and tile might give you the look you want, these materials cannot offer the combination of strength and sturdiness that you'll find with granite.</p><p>Granite countertops are designed to hold up against years of wear and tear, even in some of the messiest and most used parts of your home! Not only are they scratch-resistant, but they're also heat-resistant<em>and</em>stain-resistant. This is especially true if you seal them as required and maintain them properly.</p><p>Under normal conditions, well-maintained granite countertops can last indefinitely. Newer sealants are even designed to last longer, so you don't need to add them as frequently. It's a stress-free way to enhance the practicality and performance of your home.</p><h2>2. Natural Beauty</h2><p>While minimalist kitchens are definitely in-style, most homeowners still prefer a touch of personality and movement to their countertops. Granite more than delivers in this category.</p><p>There are countless color schemes, patterns, and designs to choose from and each slab is unique because it's created by nature! You can easily find a selection that fits your personal design preference, from white and gray varieties to darker tones. It's the perfect way to add character and visual interest to any space.</p><h2>3. Easy to Clean</h2><p>You love your kitchen, but you don't want to spend hours cleaning it. If you want a surface that wipes clean in seconds and always has a gorgeous sheen, you can't go wrong by choosing granite for your new countertops.</p><p>This stone is not only a cinch to maintain, but it's also resistant to bacteria, mold, dirt, and mildew. Most spills and spots are easy to remove with a little soap and water, or you can use a specialty product designed just for granite. If you have any stubborn, stuck-on grime, you can use a knife to gently loosen and remove the debris.</p><h2>4. Timeless Appearance</h2><p>Décor trends come and go, and it might seem like you have an endless number of options if you're tackling a kitchen remodel, laundry room re-vamp, or bathroom renovation.</p><p>While it's fun to research new ideas for inspiration, you may also prefer elements that<em>never</em>go out of style. This is what you'll find with granite. It blends beautifully into any aesthetic and can look modern, traditional, or eclectic depending on how you accessorize it.</p><p>In fact, it's the perfect backdrop for you to showcase your own<a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/decorating/how-find-personal-home-decor-style">decorating style</a>! Whether you go ultra-light, ultra-dark, or somewhere in between, you can rest assured that it's the perfect place to start.</p><h2>5. Increase Home Value</h2><p>Even if you plan to stay in your current home forever, it's still smart to work on projects that you know will add value to your property. When you make the decision to choose granite over any other type of material, you're already one step in the right direction. According to<a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/business/nahb-prospective-buyers-prefer-granite-countertops-and-stainless-steel-appliances_c">one report</a>, 57% of new home buyers prefer granite or natural stone countertops over any other option.</p><p>This feature has been in high demand for years and will be far into the foreseeable future. Prospective buyers love the universal appeal and convenience of granite and are willing to spend more to secure it in their new home.</p><p>Whether you're there to stay or plan to sell in a short time, this is one investment that will always deliver a consistently high return.</p><h2>6. Easy to Use</h2><p>Granite stays cool, absorbing heat so you can work directly on it without concern. It's the ideal place to roll out pie crusts and cookie dough, especially if you sprinkle a fine dusting of flour first to prevent anything from sticking.</p><p>This is one of the many reasons that professional chefs and at-home chefs alike love to work on granite! You don't have to worry about prepping another workstation, which cuts down on mess and cleaning later. The temperature will stay consistent, and you'll save time and energy while you work.</p><p>Plus, its innate heat resistance means that you don't have to worry if you accidentally put a hot pan down on it. You can<em>use</em>your kitchen as you need to, without constantly fretting about upkeep and appearances. It's a hard-working surface that can even hold its own against small children and pets!</p><h2>7. Easy to Repair</h2><p>Granite will hold up beautifully against a lifetime of wear. Yet, in the event that a scratch does occur, you don't have to worry. This material is easy to repair as required.</p><p>If a small chip occurs in the granite, we can repair it quickly using a putty in a matching color. Once the putty hardens, we can seal it to protect your countertop. This ensures that no liquids can penetrate into the spot, and no debris can damage it.</p><h2>Learn More About Granite Countertops Today</h2><p>Now that you know the benefits of installing granite countertops, are you ready to take the next step?

            <p>Since we’ve all been cooped up in the house for the last year, many of us have started looking for ways to refresh our spaces. And with many people moving back to working from the office, you may need a place to rest and relax at the end of a long day. Freshening up your bathroom can be a great way to breathe new life into your home, and that update should start with your vanity.</p><p>There are dozens of different options when it comes to your new bathroom countertops, but how do you know which one to pick? Read on to discover some of the most popular countertop options and their pros and cons.</p><h2>What to Look for in a Bathroom Counter</h2><p>Before we dive into all the different options available to you for your bathroom counters, let’s talk some about what to look for. When you’re shopping for a kitchen counter, you have to take a lot of durability factors into consideration, in addition to look and budget. But with bathrooms, you don’t have to limit yourself to the hardier materials.</p><p>In the bathroom, your two biggest considerations should be price and look. Your bathroom countertops will set the style for the rest of the room, so you want to make sure something that provides the look you’re going for. While it should be a somewhat durable option, you don’t have to worry as much about either heat or etching in the bathroom.</p><h2>Granite</h2><p>Granite is one of the<a href="/blog/7-key-benefits-of-having-granite-countertops">most popular options</a>for bathroom countertops, and it’s easy to see why. This natural stone is beautiful and comes in an entire rainbow of colors, from the traditional grey, white, and brown to blue and even pink. You can get slabs that are as unique as your style and which will be a stunning statement in your bathroom.</p><p>However, it is important to note that granite countertops require a good bit of maintenance, beginning with resealing them every six months. Abrasive cleaners can etch the stone, so you should only use liquid detergent and warm water to clean them. Granite counters will run you between $75 and $200 a linear foot, which is best for those with a larger budget.</p><h2>Quartz</h2><p>If you like the look of granite but not the hassle,<a href="https://www.thespruce.com/facts-about-quartz-countertops-1821233">quartz could be the perfect choice</a>for you. This material is made from stone dust set in a durable epoxy resin. Designers can create various looks with quartz, ranging from granite and marble to bolder, more modern designs.</p><p>Because quartz is effectively made of epoxy, it’s much harder to damage than marble or granite. It doesn’t require sealing, and most cleaners don’t harm it. However, you pay for what you get; quartz will run you between $110 and $250 a linear foot, depending on which look you choose.</p><h2>Tile</h2><p>If you’re looking for a budget option that will still give you a visual splash, tile can be a great choice. You can get porcelain or ceramic tiles in a wide variety of patterns, colors, and finishes. From modern subway tile to bright patterned tiles to stone tiles, you can find an option that will suit you.</p><p>The durability and maintenance requirements for your tile countertop will depend on which sort of tile you choose. Your price will also vary widely, although tile tends to be much more affordable than the other two options we’ve discussed. It is important to note that the grout lines in tile can become dirty and discolored and require special cleaning.</p><h2>Solid Surface Materials</h2><p>If you’re looking for a budget-friendly version of quartz, you may consider getting a solid-surface countertop. While quartz is made of stone particles sealed in resin, solid surface materials use acrylic and polyester pieces in resin instead. This simulates the look of stone without the same price point.</p><p>Of course, you will not get the same effect with solid surface counters as you would with quartz. And if you’re planning to redo your bathroom yourself, you may have trouble getting your hands on this material, as it often isn’t available to homeowners. But it is easy to care for, stain-resistant, and far cheaper than the natural stone options.</p><h2>Laminate</h2><p>Laminate countertops are a good option for people looking to refresh their bathrooms on a very tight budget. As the name suggests, these counters are made by laminating layers of plastic onto a particleboard core. There are many different colors and patterns available, and these counters are very easy to install yourself.</p><p>While laminate countertops of the past were questionable from a design perspective, today’s have<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/laminate-counters-look-a-lot-better-than-they-did-in-the-80s-can-they-make-a-comeback/2019/04/03/38a37bda-3f94-11e9-9361-301ffb5bd5e6_story.html">improved greatly</a>. You can now get laminate counters that look like stone, wood, leather, and even steel. And at just $10 to $30 a square foot, these countertops can give you a great bang for your buck.</p><h2>Concrete</h2><p>If you’re designing a modern bathroom, concrete can be a fantastic option for your countertops. When you imagine these counters, think less of the rough gray surface you see on your sidewalks and more of a polished surface that can be stained or even textured. Your concrete countertops will be very durable and can even be a great selling point for your house.</p><p>If you plan to do your bathroom updates yourself, concrete counters are not the best choice for you. These counters must be installed by professionals who know how to make sure they come out looking the way you want them to. You’ll pay between $75 and $150 per square foot, and if your counter cracks at some point down the line, there are few options in terms of repairs.</p><h2>Design Your New Bathroom Countertops</h2><p>Installing new bathroom countertops can be a great way to breathe new life into your space. When deciding on your material, you need to consider both your budget and the look you want. If you have more money to play with, granite or quartz can be beautiful; if you’re on a budget, go for tile, solid-surface, or laminate.</p><p>If you’d like to discover more bathroom countertop options, check out the rest of our site at Surprise Granite.

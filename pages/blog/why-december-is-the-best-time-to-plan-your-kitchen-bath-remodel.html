            <p>The timing of your kitchen and bath remodel can make all the difference in creating a space that works for your needs and budget. While most people think about construction during the warmer months, December offers unique advantages that are often overlooked.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6456ce4476abb2d4f9fbad10/6760b4115e214687326a6c6f_6760b32e5158a7b2fe43e2f0_fixr-article_2024_h-i-spending_repai_activity--.jpeg" alt="6760B4115E214687326A6C6F 6760B32E5158A7B2Fe43E2F0 Fixr Article 2024 H I Spending Repai Activity  " loading="lazy"/><figcaption>Homeowners improvements and repair 2014 to 2025</figcaption></figure><p>Remodeling costs have steadily increased since 2014, and while 2024 shows a slight dip, spending is projected to rise again in 2025.</p><p>We’ll explore why December is the ideal time to plan your remodel, from contractor availability to seasonal savings and purchasing power during the holidays.</p><h2>Contractor Availability</h2><h3>Less Project Competition</h3><p>Fewer homeowners plan kitchen and bath remodels in December because they’re focused on the holidays, leaving contractors with more open schedules. This reduced competition means you’ll have an easier time booking experienced remodelers and getting personalized attention. By starting your project planning now, you can secure their time before the busy season picks up in the new year.</p><h3>Year End Project Wrap Ups</h3><p>December is when many remodelers are finishing projects started earlier in the year, freeing up time and resources like tools and crew members. This creates a window where contractors can shift their focus to new projects without juggling ongoing work.</p><h3>Consultations and Plannings</h3><p>Kitchen and bath remodelers often prioritize consultations and planning to fill their schedules for the upcoming year. With fewer active projects, they have more time to collaborate on detailed designs and accurate estimates.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6456ce4476abb2d4f9fbad10/6760b8c7b0edea726b4b5788_6760b73b80b3e47f54a4f9e4_Surprise%2520Showroom%2520Surprise%2520Granite.jpeg" alt="6760B8C7B0Edea726B4B5788 6760B73B80B3E47F54A4F9E4 Surprise%2520Showroom%2520Surprise%2520Granite countertop sample" loading="lazy"/><figcaption>Surprise Granite Showroom</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://g.co/kgs/jD3fbUv">Visit a showroom</a>between December 1st and December 23rd, as many contractors wind down during the last week of the month for Christmas and New Years.</p><p>Considering these reasons, December is the perfect time to<a href="https://form.jotform.com/221357778919068">talk with a designer</a>and start planning your kitchen or bath remodel. If you wait until the new year, you may find yourself competing for time and availability as schedules quickly fill up.</p><h2>Financial Leverage</h2><figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6456ce4476abb2d4f9fbad10/6760bae5ebb194a55117e98d_6760bab2e4d6c926ee6c2404_Kitchen%2520Remodel%2520Deposit.jpeg" alt="Kitchen remodeling project" loading="lazy"/><figcaption>Arizona Homeowner reviewing kitchen and bath quote by Surprise Granite</figcaption></figure><p>Putting down a deposit for your kitchen or bath remodel in December can save you thousands compared to waiting until after the new year. Remodelers often raise their prices in January due to higher demand as more homeowners begin their projects.</p><p>By putting a deposit down now, you can lock in current prices for both materials and labor while scheduling the project to start at a later date. This allows you to take advantage of your money’s purchasing power and secure priority scheduling before prices increase.<a href="https://form.jotform.com/221357778919068">Get a free estimate here</a>.</p><h2>Seasonal Savings</h2><h3>Discounts & Promotions</h3><h4>Better Service Deals</h4><p>Many kitchen and bath remodelers offer discounts and promotions to attract new clients during the slower season. These deals are designed to fill gaps in their schedules and secure projects ahead of the busy spring months. Homeowners can often take advantage of reduced labor costs or bundled services, making remodeling projects more affordable. By acting now, you can stretch your budget further while still working with top-tier professionals.</p><h4>Product Clearance Sale</h4><figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6456ce4476abb2d4f9fbad10/6760ac7944f20df6fbd2372b_6760ac23dce32ca14de834e8_Surprise%2520Granite%2520Warehouse%2520Products.jpeg" alt="6760Ac7944F20Df6Fbd2372B 6760Ac23Dce32Ca14De834E8 Surprise%2520Granite%2520Warehouse%2520Products countertop sample" loading="lazy"/><figcaption>Countertops, cabinets, tile and flooring samples in Surprise Granite showroom.</figcaption></figure><p>Kitchen and bath remodelers often hold end-of-year clearance sales to make room for new inventory arriving in January. Items like<a href="/marketplace/slabs/">countertops</a>,<a href="https://store.surprisegranite.com/collections/tile">tiles</a>,<a href="https://store.surprisegranite.com/collections/all-sinks">sinks</a>, and other accessories are discounted to clear out older stock and free up storage space. For homeowners, this is an excellent opportunity to find high-quality products at lower prices, maximizing the value of their remodeling budget.</p><h2>Tax Advantages</h2><h3>Maximizing Tax Benefits from Kitchen and Bath Remodels</h3><p>Kitchen and bath remodels can provide significant tax advantages when planned carefully. While general remodeling expenses are not directly tax-deductible, funding the project through a mortgage or cash-out refinance allows you to deduct the interest as part of your home mortgage interest deduction. Remodels that address medical needs, such as lowering countertops, installing accessible sinks, or widening doorways, may qualify as medical expense deductions if they meet IRS criteria.</p><p>Energy-efficient upgrades, like water-saving faucets, energy-efficient appliances, or LED lighting, can qualify for federal tax credits, reducing your overall tax burden. Tracking remodeling costs is essential, as these expenses increase your home's basis, potentially reducing capital gains taxes when you sell. With these benefits in mind, kitchen and bath remodels can add value to your home while providing smart financial savings.</p><h3>Tax-Deductible Kitchen and Bath Remodels for Rental Properties</h3><p>Remodeling a rental property’s kitchen or bathroom can increase its value and attract higher-paying tenants. Certain upgrades may also be tax-deductible, helping offset the cost of the remodel. Below are some common deductible improvements for rental properties:</p><ul><li>Repairing worn-out countertops or cabinets</li><li>Replacing old kitchen or bathroom flooring</li><li>Upgrading appliances</li><li>Repainting walls or ceilings</li><li>Installing energy-efficient light fixtures</li><li>Fixing or replacing windows and doors</li></ul><p>To qualify, these expenses must be considered current repairs rather than improvements that increase the property’s overall value. Keeping accurate documentation is essential for claiming these deductions, and consulting with a tax advisor ensures compliance with tax regulations.</p><h2>Holiday Insights</h2><p>The holidays are when your kitchen and bathroom face their biggest challenges, whether it’s hosting large gatherings or accommodating extra guests. These high-demand moments highlight what works and what doesn’t, giving you the chance to take notes for future improvements. By paying attention to things like layout efficiency and missing features, you can start building a clearer picture of what your next remodel should focus on.</p><figure></figure><p>Watch this amazing video by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kitchinsider">Kitchinsider</a>to see if you're kitchen is optimized. And follow the steps to plan your kitchen remodel.</p><h3>Layout and Space Efficiency</h3><p>The layout and available space in your kitchen or bathroom play a major role in how well these areas function during busy times like the holidays. When the design doesn’t allow for smooth movement or enough workspace, it can make hosting feel chaotic.</p><p>Common insights you might notice include:</p><ul><li>Limited counter space for food preparation or serving</li><li>Insufficient storage for cookware, dishes, or cleaning supplies</li><li>Narrow walkways that cause congestion in high-traffic areas</li><li>Poor placement of storage or pantry areas, making it hard to access items</li></ul><p>Remodeling solutions like expanding counter space, creating better storage configurations, or opening up walkways can significantly improve how these spaces work for your daily life and future gatherings.</p><h3>Functionality and Features</h3><figure><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6456ce4476abb2d4f9fbad10/6760c59191471341e6d97ff5_6760c56e28febbfa96cdc9d2_Bad%2520Kitchen%2520Design%2520and%2520Functionality.jpeg" alt="Kitchen remodeling project" loading="lazy"/><figcaption>Dysfunctional Kitchen vs Functional Kitchen</figcaption></figure><p>The functionality of your kitchen and bathroom comes into sharp focus during the holidays when these spaces are used more than ever. Outdated features or missing elements can make everyday tasks harder and less efficient, especially when you’re hosting guests.</p><p>Common insights you might notice include:</p><ul><li>A sink that’s too small for large pots or heavy use</li><li>Poor lighting that makes food prep or cleaning difficult</li><li>Appliances that are unreliable or not suited to holiday demands</li><li>Bathrooms lacking enough towel hooks, counter space, or ventilation</li></ul><p>Upgrading key features like installing a deeper sink, adding task lighting, or replacing outdated appliances can make your kitchen and bathroom more functional and ready to handle high-demand situations with ease.</p><p>Taking advantage of December’s slower pace and unique opportunities can set you up for a smoother and more cost-effective kitchen or bath remodel. Use this time to plan, save, and prepare so you’re ready to start the new year with your project already in motion.</p><p><a href="https://form.jotform.com/221357778919068">Schedule a consultation today</a>to take advantage of this window of opportunity.

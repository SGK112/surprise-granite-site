            <p>There's nothing more uninspiring than a boring or dated kitchen. Dull lighting, worn cabinets, and peeling floor tiles won't exactly inspire great culinary efforts. And you won't have a kitchen where people will want to gather.</p><p>Upgrading your kitchen should start with your work surface. New countertops can inject style and quality into your workspace. Keep reading to discover 15 kitchen countertops that will transform your kitchen in 2024!</p><h2>1. Luxurious Waterfall</h2><p>Waterfall countertops are among the most popular countertop styles available today. With the waterfall style, you'll see the same material extend across the work surface and drape over the sides. The look is one of seamless movement.</p><p>Granite and marble always should be in consideration when you're considering kitchen renovation ideas. And they're especially appropriate for waterfall countertops.</p><p><a href="/blog/7-reasons-to-install-granite-countertops">Granite surfaces</a>, for instance, come in a range of colors and textures to suit anyone's taste. With a highly polished marble surface, you'll create a sleek and elegant sense of style. White marble with some delicate veining is the perfect waterfall choice in a white kitchen.</p><h2>2. Go Green</h2><p>Many of today's kitchen designs favor classic white or neutrals. But if you're more interested in making a splash, reach for green as the supporting element for your countertops. Green cabinets, backsplashes, and tiles would add intensity to white porcelain countertops, for instance.</p><p>Green is known for sparking a rich array of<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/color-psychology-green-2795817">psychological reactions</a>. It can be energizing or tranquil depending on the particular shade you choose. Go with a muted green to build a natural aura in your space, or reach for Kelly green for a more intense sense of impact.</p><h2>3. Industrial Chic</h2><p>Are you hoping for a more industrial look in your kitchen? Metal countertops, in either matte or glossy finishes, can create this aesthetic. As you plot out a kitchen makeover, look toward stainless steel, brass, or zinc.</p><p>Stainless steel countertops offer durability and a sleek, clean sense of style. You won't have to worry about heat or water sensitivity, either. These countertops can handle hot pans, and they clean up well.</p><p>Paired with some warm wood accents or a textured floor, steel countertops can be the centerpiece of an industrial cook space.</p><h2>4. A Family-Friendly Expanse</h2><p>Make your countertops the star of the show with a clean, dressed-down approach to your kitchen update. Rather than mixing materials or playing with textures, choose a simple, large island that can double as a prep space and homework space.</p><p>When you have kids or other family members always convening in the kitchen, you don't need a lot of special features. A simple expanse of solid material for an island is it. Choose a deep black color or charcoal gray for a handsome countertop that will go well with everything.</p><p>And when you're designing this look, you can't go wrong with<a href="/blog/the-best-quartz-countertop-colors-for-your-kitchen-2022">quartz countertops</a>. Quartz is one of the most sought-after materials in new homes today.</p><h2>5. Tiered Tops</h2><p>Countertops don't have to consist of one level. So why not add a few tiers?</p><p>The tiered look creates geometric interest while also offering functionality. Tiered countertops are great if you have kids or family members of varying heights in your household.</p><p>Engineered stone, granite, and quartz are among the best choices for this approach to new countertops. With engineered stone, you'll get heat-resistant surfaces that are safe and strong. If you have kids hoping to contribute to the cooking, you'll want a surface that can stand up to the wear and tear!</p><h2>6. Glossy Marble Sophistication</h2><p>Glossy marble countertops remain a popular choice for kitchens in 2024. A clean white marble countertop is the perfect complement to white cupboards and backsplashes.</p><p>Marble countertops can come with prominent veins, too, if you're trying to build a focal point in your kitchen. And regardless of whether you choose marble with more robust veining or not, you'll get a surface that looks rich and enchanting.</p><p>You can find marble in white, gray, pink, and other tones. Marble always will be a statement feature of your kitchen, too, which can help boost your home's value.</p><h2>7. Butcher Block Functionality</h2><p>Butcher block countertops provide a warm, rustic aesthetic that can last for over two decades. With painted cabinets and patterned floor tiles, you'll have an inviting kitchen with a resilient work surface.</p><p>With butcher block countertops, you can choose woods like oak, cherry, or maple. You'll want to go with hardwood selections since they'll be able to resist cut marks or scratches.</p><h2>8. Live Edge Countertops</h2><p>You may have seen live-edge coffee or dining tables and loved the look. But did you know that you can bring that sense of style to your kitchen countertops, too?</p><p>Live-edge countertops create a show-stopping experience in your kitchen. Imagine a slab of walnut or oak with an irregular edge defining your kitchen. The unfinished edge creates a natural, treelike look that will be completely unique in your kitchen.</p><h2>9. Utilitarian Concrete</h2><p>Concrete countertops are a surprisingly versatile choice for a kitchen renovation. You can choose natural gray concrete for an industrial look that always looks good. But there are more options than you might expect.</p><p>For instance, stains can accentuate textures to create a surface that looks more like quartz. Dyes can create a more uniform color. Choose from among blue, orange, and a host of other options.</p><h2>10. Mixed Materials</h2><p>You don't have to stick with a single material for your kitchen countertops. Mixing together a few options can add texture, color, and beauty. You'll be able to create a look that can be anything from cottage-like to contemporary.</p><p>Why not mix ceramic tiles and wood? It's easy to assume ceramic tiles only belong on backsplashes. But they also can make a splash as a new countertop.</p><p>Pair a section of tiles with a butcher block or slate top to create warmth. Or try a more modern pairing of concrete and wood. You can make your kitchen island one material while your work surfaces that sit flush against the walls are made of another.</p><h2>11. Rugged Appeal</h2><p>If you're hoping to craft a rugged bachelor pad kitchen or bring an earthier look to your space, natural stone is a good option. But while quartz and granite may still be the<a href="/blog/6-things-to-consider-before-replacing-your-kitchen-countertop">top picks</a>in this category, you may want to look elsewhere to create the right vibe.</p><p>Don't overlook slate. This beautiful stone may not come in the variety of colors or veining options that its peer stones offer, but you'll still be gaining an attractive and more cost-effective countertop solution that looks like it's just been harvested from the earth.</p><p>Slate is a non-porous metamorphic rock that is easy to clean. Its gray tones range from warm to cool, meaning you're bound to find one that works with your kitchen's aesthetic.</p><h2>12. Curvy Shapes</h2><p>When you're redoing your kitchen countertops, consider going with an unconventional shape. While countertops typically are rectangular, they don't have to be.</p><p>Imagine a horseshoe shape with seating around the edges. Or picture a wavy island countertop adding movement to a large kitchen. Unique shapes can anchor kitchens and turn them into works of art.</p><p>If you don't have room to bend the entire workspace, introduce more subtle curves. Rounded edges in place of sharp corners can create a soft and inviting look.</p><h2>13. Clear Elegance</h2><p>When you want to keep your style clean and elegant, go with glass. This increasingly popular countertop material can enhance any kitchen with a sense of lightness.</p><p>Glass can be cut to any shape for an island, and it is available in a variety of colors and textures. While glass countertops do run the risk of cracking, the benefits far outweigh the negatives.</p><p>Glass is easy to maintain, resisting both heat and stains. It also can be enhanced with<a href="https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-led-lights-6752857">LED lighting</a>to create an ambient kitchen.</p><h2>14. Farmhouse Warmth</h2><p>A farmhouse sink and Shaker cabinets can form the backbone of a farmhouse-inspired kitchen. But what type of countertop can complete the look?</p><p>Copper countertops can make your dream kitchen come alive. Copper's rich warmth and metallic sheen will be the perfect addition to farmhouse decor in any kitchen.</p><p>Copper can look rustic and refined all at once. Paired with a copper range hood or fixtures, you'll have a harmonious new kitchen that's a great family gathering point. And if your countertops are sealed, they'll retain a shiny and warm color.</p><p>Unsealed copper will oxidize, giving it rich tones of green or red. In farmhouse settings, this color variation can look charming and vibrant.</p><h2>15. Vintage Appeal</h2><p>Are you looking for an upgraded yet retro kitchen on a<a href="/contact-us">leaner budget</a>? Formica and laminate are the way to go.</p><p>You can choose retro styles that resemble wood with pronounced grain patterns. Or go with a bold orange or olive green for a distinctive flair. With some patterned floor tiles or bright cabinets, you'll create a vibrant space.</p><h2>Upgrade Your Kitchen Countertops</h2><p>When you look at today's most stylish kitchen countertops, you'll see that there are tons of options. Install a sleek waterfall island for a luxurious look or try mixing materials. Retro countertops and tiered tops also are popular options today.</p><p>At Surprise Granite, we've helped complete over 400 remodeling projects with over 500 contractors in Arizona.

Choosing between quartz and granite countertops is one of the most important decisions you'll make during your kitchen remodel. Both materials offer exceptional beauty and durability, but each has distinct characteristics that may make one better suited to your lifestyle and Arizona home. Let's break down everything you need to know.

## Understanding the Basics

### What Is Granite?

Granite is a natural stone formed deep within the Earth's crust over millions of years. Each slab is quarried from the ground, cut, and polished to reveal its unique pattern of minerals and colors. No two granite slabs are exactly alike.

At Surprise Granite, we carry over 200 granite options ranging from classic Black Galaxy to exotic Blue Bahia.

### What Is Quartz?

Quartz countertops are engineered surfaces made from approximately 90-95% crushed natural quartz crystals combined with resins and pigments. This manufacturing process allows for consistent patterns and a wide range of colors not found in nature.

Our collection includes over 1,100 quartz options from top brands like MSI Surfaces, Cambria, Silestone, and Radianz.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

### Durability

**Granite:** Extremely hard and durable. Rates 6-7 on the Mohs hardness scale. Can chip if hit with a heavy object at the edge.

**Quartz:** Slightly more flexible than granite, making it less prone to chipping. The resin content adds some impact resistance.

**Winner:** Tie - both are excellent for daily kitchen use.

### Heat Resistance

**Granite:** Naturally heat resistant. You can place hot pots directly on granite, though we recommend trivets to prevent thermal shock in extreme cases.

**Quartz:** Resins can be damaged by extreme heat. Always use trivets for hot pots and pans. This is especially important in Arizona's hot climate where surfaces can already be warm.

**Winner:** Granite - better for busy cooks who might forget to use trivets.

### Stain Resistance

**Granite:** Porous and requires annual sealing to prevent stains from oils, wine, and acidic foods.

**Quartz:** Non-porous and highly stain-resistant. Coffee, wine, and oils wipe right off without leaving marks.

**Winner:** Quartz - virtually maintenance-free stain protection.

### Maintenance

**Granite:** Requires annual sealing and prompt cleanup of spills. Clean with stone-specific cleaners or mild soap and water.

**Quartz:** Simply wipe with mild soap and water. No sealing ever required.

**Winner:** Quartz - perfect for busy Arizona families.

### Appearance Options

**Granite:** Nature creates the patterns, so options are limited to what's quarried. Colors range from blacks and browns to whites, greens, and blues. Each slab is unique.

**Quartz:** Engineering allows for consistent patterns and colors you won't find in nature. Popular marble-look designs offer elegance without marble's maintenance.

**Winner:** Quartz for variety; Granite for natural uniqueness.

### Cost

**Granite:** Entry-level granites start around $40-50 per square foot installed. Exotic varieties can exceed $100 per square foot.

**Quartz:** Generally ranges from $50-120 per square foot installed, depending on brand and style.

**Winner:** Tie - prices overlap significantly. Get quotes for specific materials.

### Eco-Friendliness

**Granite:** 100% natural with minimal processing. However, quarrying and transportation have environmental impacts.

**Quartz:** Uses abundant natural quartz but includes synthetic resins. Manufacturing is energy-intensive.

**Winner:** Granite slightly - but both have environmental considerations.

## Arizona-Specific Considerations

### UV Exposure

If your countertops will be near windows with direct sunlight or in outdoor kitchen applications:

**Granite:** UV stable. Colors won't fade with sun exposure.

**Quartz:** Some quartz products can yellow or fade with prolonged UV exposure. For outdoor Arizona kitchens, consider UV-stable options or choose granite.

### Desert Climate

Arizona's dry climate means less worry about humidity-related issues for either material. However, extreme temperature swings between day and night are worth considering.

**Granite:** Handles temperature variations naturally.

**Quartz:** Generally fine indoors but may experience more expansion/contraction outdoors.

### Pool Area Kitchens

For outdoor living spaces around pools:

**Granite:** Excellent choice - naturally handles water, sun, and heat.

**Quartz:** Check for outdoor-rated options. Standard quartz isn't recommended for full outdoor exposure.

## Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Granite If You:
- Want each slab to be truly unique
- Plan to install in outdoor kitchen areas
- Prefer natural materials
- Don't mind annual sealing

### Choose Quartz If You:
